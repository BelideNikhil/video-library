            "The 2019 Dakar Rally was hosted by just one country for the first time in its 42-year history - Peru. Traversing 5,000 kms of the Peruvian terrain over 10 stages can take a toll on even the most hardened rally racers across the world! However, this didn't stop 534 brave competitors from lining up at the ceremonial start in Lima, Peru. Among these bravehearts were CS Santhosh, Joaquim Rodrigues and Oriol Mena, the flagbearers for Hero MotoSports Team Rally. As one of the only two Indian teams on the grid, Hero is carrying a fair bit of weight on its shoulders.",

Yes, we know, c90adventures already did this and did it better. You might say the boys were so inspired that they wanted to have their own CT90 story to tell. Buckle up for a coast-to-coast Alaskan adventure and a journey beyond the end of the Dalton Highway, to the northernmost town in the United States.",
